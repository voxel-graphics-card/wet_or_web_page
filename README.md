# Enhanced Water Ripple Effect
This is an interactive web-based water ripple simulation with additional visual effects, designed to be fully responsive and work seamlessly across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Features
Interactive Water Ripples: Create ripples by moving your cursor (desktop) or finger (touch devices) on the canvas. Clicking or tapping generates larger, more impactful waves.
Dynamic Background: A subtle gradient background that changes based on the selected theme.
Particle Effects: Animated particles add depth and visual interest to the scene.
Rain Effect: Toggle a simulated rain effect that generates small, continuous ripples.
Theme Toggle: Switch between a dark mode and a light mode.
Performance Statistics: Optionally display real-time FPS, ripple count, and particle count.
Background Music: Plays an "ink puddle" music track, which can be toggled on/off.
Story Overlay: An informative story text panel that appears by default and can be closed or reopened.
Custom Cursor: A custom visual cursor is displayed when interacting with the canvas on desktop, disappearing when the mouse leaves the canvas area or when hovering over UI elements.
Responsive Design: Optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience.
Dropdown Menu: All control options are neatly organized within a dropdown "Menu" button, improving UI cleanliness, especially on smaller screens.
